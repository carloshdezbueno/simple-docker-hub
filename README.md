## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker Compose)

The easiest way to get started is with Docker Compose.

1.  Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  docklink:
    image: ghcr.io/yourusername/docklink:latest # Or build locally
    container_name: docklink
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - DB_PATH=/data/links.db
      - FLASK_APP=app.py
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./uploads:/app/static/uploads
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2.  Run it:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  Open `http://localhost:5000` and start adding links!
